# Design Philosophy

The following document paraphrases the design qualities that will govern the development of this operating system.
Personally, These are the qualities I strive for in any software I develop. If you think something else should be added please feel free to contact me.

### Frugality
Make the best use of what you are given. 
Eating resources is easy, making judicious use is often the harder but smarter thing to do.

### Portability
Best engineered parts are often independent of each other and yet they fit together seamlessly.

### Open source because Collaboration is the Future
I am aware of my limitations and thats why I am overcoming them by making project open source.

### Perfect Design is a Dangerous Myth
I personally believe in a integrated OS like the Apple's MacOS.
Many developers believe in a more distributed architecture like the Linux.
I say why not both?
In Tranquil I see a new start which can enable both design architectures to work together.
We can have a standalone kernel which will allow developers to build their own OS.
We can also have an official OS built on the top of the kernel to support seamless integration.

### All process communication must be through a unified format.
Yes I know the best feature of a software is the flexibility of several modes of communication between processes.
But this principle is placed here for a different reason. 
I am NOT saying we will not support communication through several modes, rather I am saying we the developers will only use a few pre-decided modes of communication for internal system development.
This I believe should make development faster and more organised.

### KISS- Keep it Simple Stupid
