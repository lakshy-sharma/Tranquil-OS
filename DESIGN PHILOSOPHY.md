# Design Philosphy

The following document paraphrases the qualities that I strive for in any software I develop.

### Frugality
Make the best use of what you are given. 
Eating resources is easy, making judicious use is often the harder thing to do.

### Portability
Best engineered parts are the parts that are independent of each other and yet seamlessely fit together.

### Open source because Collaboration is the Future
I am aware of my limitations and thats why I am overcoming them by making project open source.

### Perfect Design is a Dangerous Myth
I personally believe in a integrated OS like the Apple's MacOS. Many developers beleive in the distributed architecture like the Linux.
I say why not both?
In Tranquil I see a new start which can enable bother design architectures seamlessely integrating with each other. (See portability)

### All IPC must be through a unified format.
Yes I know the best feature of a software is the felxibility of several modes of communication between processes. But this principle is placed here for a different reason. 
I am NOT saying we will not support communication through several modes, rather I am saying we will only use a few pre-decided modes for communication for internal system development. This I believe should make development faster in small cycles.

### KISS- Keep it Simple Stupid
